1. Added optional certificate validity field in libcertifier.cfg (default 365 days). 
2. Added optional common name field in libcertifier.cfg. If no CN value is specified, node address is used.
3. Added extended key usage values field in libcertifier.cfg. If no values are specified, default usage (client auth, server auth) is used.
4. PKCS12 Encryption iterations for openSSL and mbedTLS were increased to 50000 (were previously 4096 and 8192 respectively).
5. Libcertifier no longer requires a valid Organization Unit (OU) in new certificates, due to lite certificates not containing an OU field.
