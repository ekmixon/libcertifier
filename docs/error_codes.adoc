== Error Codes

libcertifier error codes can be found in link:../internal_headers/certifier/error.h[/certifier/error.h]

== certifierUtil

All errors in the xref:cli_usage.adoc[command-line interface (CLI)] are in JSON format and printed out to stderr.  Example -

== Library Error Codes

The `library_error_code` returns the error code from an underlying library, such as mbedTLS, OpenSSL, etc.  The `library_error_message`, when available, is the libraries error message for that error code.  For example, in mbedTLS, `library_error_message` is the equivalent of calling the mbedTLS `strerror` tool.
